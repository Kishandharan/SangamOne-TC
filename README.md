# SangamOne-TC
Fancy calculator for terminal fans! From SangamOne.

### Requirements
Below are the requirements to run SangamOne-TC:    

- Python or NodeJS installed
- A windows machine
- Git installed (for installation)

if you have never installed or used NodeJS or python but want to use this tool,    
we recommend going with Python since installing it is simpler.    
We will soon try to make a Linux and MacOS version as wellðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š!    

### Setup
Now let's start installing SOTC.    
Open your terminal and go to the location where you want to install SOTC,    
and type in "git clone https://github.com/Kishandharan/SangamOne-TC.git".    

This will create a new folder named "SangamOne-TC" in your current working directory.    
Now go inside that folder, and extract the contents of it into a folder named "product".    
At this point, delete the product.zip file if it still exists.    
Now you have successfully installed SOTC but for it to work in the terminal,    
we have to add the batch file directory to the environment variable named "PATH".    

So to do that, go to windows search and type in "env" and click on "Edit the system enviroment variables".    
Now after opening that navigate to the "Advanced" tab and click on the "Environment Variables" button.    
And now under the "System variables" section, scroll down until you find "Path", click on it and     
click on the "Edit" button just below the section. Now on the dialog box that appears, click on the    
"New" button on the right side. Now go to the installation directory of SOTC and inside that directory,    
go inside the "product" directory that we extracted. Now what we do depends on whether you want the NodeJS    
version or the Python version. For the NodeJS version, go inside the "JS" directory and copy the full path of current
working directory and paste it in the dialog. Now for Python it is pretty much the same but you just have to go inside the    
"Python" directory and copy it's path instead of the "JS" directory's path.

So after doing all this, SOTC will be finally installed and configured in a proper way.
